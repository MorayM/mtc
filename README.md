# Moray Macdonald â€” Professional Website

This repository contains the source code for my professional website where I showcase my work as a Fractional Tech Lead and Independent Consultant. The site is built with Astro, focusing on performance, accessibility, and clean design, and has been mostly vibe-coded as an experiment with Cursor and claude-3.5-sonnet (results have been mixed!)

## About

As a Principal Engineer and Fractional Tech Lead, I help early-stage teams and non-technical founders build sustainable, production-ready products. This website serves as both a portfolio and a resource for potential clients to understand my approach to technical leadership and development.

## Key Features

- Modern, responsive design with a focus on readability
- Case studies and client success stories
- Pre-Flight Check assessment tool for potential clients
- Detailed service offerings for technical leadership and development
- Contact form for project inquiries

## Technology Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build) for static site generation
- Custom CSS with a focus on performance (no Tailwind, despite Claude's protestations)
- SVG animations and modern design elements
- Optimized for accessibility and SEO

## Commands
