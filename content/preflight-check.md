# Pre-Flight Check: MVP Review & Risk Assessment

You've built something with tools like Windsurf or Lovable. It's working (mostly), and you're nearly ready to launch — but you're wondering: is it secure? Is it maintainable? Is it about to fall apart?

This service is for non-technical founders and product owners who want a second opinion before putting their MVP in front of real users or investors.

## What You Get

- **Intro Call (30 mins)** — A quick chat to understand your goals and setup.
- **Codebase + Architecture Review** — I look under the hood for risks, bottlenecks, and red flags.
- **Plain-English Report (PDF)** — Actionable findings, risk areas, and recommendations.
- **Follow-Up Q&A Call (30 mins)** — Ask questions, clarify next steps, and decide what to fix (and when).

## Ideal For

- Solo or non-technical founders
- Teams using AI tools for rapid prototyping
- Early MVPs heading toward production
