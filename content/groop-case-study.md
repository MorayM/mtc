# Case Study: Groop — Leading a Technical Turnaround

Groop, a people management platform for community organisations, needed internal technical leadership after transitioning away from an external development agency. I joined as their first in-house developer and took full ownership of the technical direction.

## My Role

- Took over an existing codebase with minimal documentation
- Scoped and executed a full re-architecture of the data layer, improving performance by over 300×
- Introduced CI/CD pipelines and streamlined the deployment process
- Led the migration of over 20 servers to AWS, including database and infrastructure administration
- Added key features including integrated video conferencing and responsive UX improvements
- Built and mentored a small internal dev team
- Established Agile workflows and cross-team collaboration practices

## The Outcome

Groop now runs on a scalable, maintainable stack with automated deployment and monitoring. Performance has improved dramatically, and the internal team is equipped with clearer processes and tools.
