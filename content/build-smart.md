# Build Smart From Day One: Early-Stage Tech Planning

You’re at the very beginning of your product journey. You have the idea, maybe a design or a prototype, but you want to make sure you’re building it right — not just fast.

This one-off consulting package sets you up with the right tools, architecture, and dev process before you write a single line of code (or hire someone who will).

## What You Get

- **Discovery Call (60 mins)** — I learn about your product, vision, and constraints.
- **Technical Blueprint (PDF)** — Recommended stack, architecture sketch, database shape, risks, and setup tips.
- **Follow-Up Q&A (30 mins)** — Answering remaining questions, reviewing changes, and defining next steps.

## Ideal For

- Founders building their first product
- Early-stage teams planning development
- Anyone unsure where to start (or worried about choosing wrong)
