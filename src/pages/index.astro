          <h1>Moray Macdonald &mdash; Fractional Tech Lead &amp; Independent Consultant</h1>

          <p>
            I help non-technical founders and small teams build and scale smarter. Whether you're
            launching your first product, working with AI-generated code, or navigating messy legacy
            systems, I'm here to bring clarity, stability, and experience to your technical journey.
          </p>

          <p>
            With over 12 years of experience across startups, consultancies, and mission-driven
            organisations, I combine strategic thinking with deep hands-on skills. From architecture
            to UX, from DevOps to roadmap planning &mdash; I speak founder and developer.

        I support climate-focused and LGBTQ+ inclusive businesses, and offer preferential rates to

        fairer, more sustainable future.
