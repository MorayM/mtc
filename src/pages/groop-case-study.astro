      <h1>Case Study: Groop — Leading a Technical Turnaround</h1>

      <p>
        Groop, a people management platform for community organisations, needed internal technical
        leadership after transitioning away from an external development agency. I joined as their
        first in-house developer and took full ownership of the technical direction.

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Took over an existing codebase with minimal documentation</li>
          <li>
            Scoped and executed a full re-architecture of the data layer, improving performance by
            over 300×
          </li>
          <li>Introduced CI/CD pipelines and streamlined the deployment process</li>
          <li>
            Led the migration of over 20 servers to AWS, including database and infrastructure
            administration
          </li>
          <li>
            Added key features including integrated video conferencing and responsive UX
            improvements
          </li>
          <li>Built and mentored a small internal dev team</li>
          <li>Established Agile workflows and cross-team collaboration practices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          Groop now runs on a scalable, maintainable stack with automated deployment and monitoring.
          Performance has improved dramatically, and the internal team is equipped with clearer
          processes and tools. This long-term engagement exemplifies how trusted, strategic
          technical leadership can transform a product from fragile to future-ready.
