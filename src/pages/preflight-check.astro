      <h1>Pre-Flight Check: MVP Review & Risk Assessment</h1>

      <p>
        You've built something with tools like Windsurf or Lovable. It's working (mostly), and
        you're nearly ready to launch — but you're wondering: is it secure? Is it maintainable? Is
        it about to fall apart?
      </p>

      <p>
        This service is for non-technical founders and product owners who want a second opinion
        before putting their MVP in front of real users or investors.
